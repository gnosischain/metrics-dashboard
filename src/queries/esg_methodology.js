# ESG Carbon Footprint Methodology

## Overview

This methodology outlines our approach to calculating the carbon footprint of the Gnosis blockchain network, focusing on energy consumption patterns and environmental impact assessment.

## Carbon Intensity Factors (CIF)

Our analysis utilizes country-specific Carbon Intensity Factors to convert energy consumption into CO₂ emissions:

### Regional CIF Values (gCO₂/kWh)
- **Iceland**: 23 gCO₂/kWh (primarily geothermal and hydroelectric)
- **Norway**: 18 gCO₂/kWh (hydroelectric dominant)
- **France**: 79 gCO₂/kWh (nuclear and renewable mix)
- **Sweden**: 41 gCO₂/kWh (nuclear and hydroelectric)
- **Germany**: 420 gCO₂/kWh (coal and gas transition)
- **United States**: 393 gCO₂/kWh (mixed fossil and renewable)
- **China**: 555 gCO₂/kWh (coal-heavy grid)
- **Global Average**: 475 gCO₂/kWh (weighted by production)

## Methodology Components

### 1. Node Distribution Analysis

**Geographic Mapping**: We analyze the geographic distribution of Gnosis network nodes using:
- IP geolocation data from network crawlers
- Validator registry information
- Staking pool geographic disclosures
- Public infrastructure provider locations

**Validation Process**: Cross-reference multiple data sources to improve location accuracy and account for VPN/proxy usage that might obscure true node locations.

### 2. Hardware Power Profiling

**Reference Hardware Configurations**:
- **Home Staker Setup**: Intel i5-12400 + 32GB RAM + 2TB NVMe SSD
  - Idle Power: ~85W
  - Active Power: ~120W
  - Annual Consumption: ~950 kWh

- **Professional Setup**: Intel i7-13700K + 64GB RAM + 4TB NVMe SSD
  - Idle Power: ~110W  
  - Active Power: ~165W
  - Annual Consumption: ~1,200 kWh

- **Cloud Instance**: AWS m5.xlarge equivalent
  - Allocated Power: ~140W (estimated)
  - Annual Consumption: ~1,225 kWh

**Power Measurement Methodology**:
1. **Baseline Measurement**: System idle power consumption
2. **Incremental Load**: Additional power for consensus participation
3. **Network Activity**: Variable power based on transaction processing
4. **Storage Operations**: Power for blockchain data management

### 3. Client Distribution Assessment

**Consensus Layer Clients**:
- Lighthouse: 45% market share (estimated)
- Teku: 25% market share
- Lodestar: 15% market share  
- Nimbus: 10% market share
- Other: 5% market share

**Execution Layer Clients**:
- Erigon: 40% market share (estimated)
- Geth: 35% market share
- Besu: 15% market share
- Nethermind: 10% market share

**Impact on Power Consumption**: Different client implementations have varying resource requirements, affecting overall network energy consumption.

### 4. Network Load Modeling

**Transaction Processing**: Energy consumption scales with:
- Transaction volume (transactions per second)
- Block gas usage
- State tree operations
- Cross-chain bridge activity

**Consensus Participation**: Base energy for:
- Block proposal duties
- Attestation responsibilities  
- Sync committee participation
- Validator set management

### 5. Calculation Framework

**Total Network Emissions** = Σ(Node_i × Hours_i × Power_i × CIF_i)

Where:
- Node_i = Number of nodes in region i
- Hours_i = Operating hours (8,760 for full year)
- Power_i = Average power consumption per node (kW)
- CIF_i = Carbon intensity factor for region i (gCO₂/kWh)

**Annual CO₂ Estimation**:
\`\`\`
Estimated Range: 1,200 - 2,800 tCO₂/year
Current Best Estimate: ~1,850 tCO₂/year
Per Transaction: ~0.001 kgCO₂/tx
\`\`\`

## Data Sources and Limitations

### Primary Data Sources
1. **Network Topology**: Gnosis node discovery and peer connection data
2. **Geographic Data**: IP geolocation services and infrastructure provider mapping
3. **Hardware Benchmarks**: Community surveys and public validator configurations  
4. **Energy Grids**: International Energy Agency (IEA) national grid data
5. **Transaction Data**: On-chain activity metrics and gas consumption patterns

### Key Limitations and Uncertainties

**Geographic Accuracy**: IP-based geolocation can be imprecise, especially for:
- VPN and proxy services masking true locations
- Mobile and dynamic IP addresses
- Cloud infrastructure spanning multiple regions

**Hardware Diversity**: Significant variation in actual hardware configurations:
- Home validators may use less efficient older hardware
- Professional setups might employ high-efficiency components
- Cloud instances have varying underlying infrastructure

**Client Efficiency Variations**: Different consensus and execution clients have:
- Varying memory and CPU requirements
- Different optimization levels
- Distinct synchronization strategies

**Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)**: Data center hosting factors:
- Cooling and infrastructure overhead (typical PUE: 1.2-1.8)
- Geographic climate impact on cooling needs
- Renewable energy procurement by hosting providers

## Improvement Roadmap

### Short-term Enhancements (3-6 months)
- **Enhanced Geolocation**: Implement multi-source geographic validation
- **Community Hardware Survey**: Collect real-world power consumption data
- **Client Benchmarking**: Systematic performance and power testing

### Medium-term Developments (6-12 months)
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Integrate with validator monitoring tools
- **Dynamic Load Modeling**: Variable power based on network activity
- **Carbon Accounting Integration**: Direct renewable energy tracking

### Long-term Vision (12+ months)
- **Automated Data Collection**: Self-reporting validator power metrics
- **Predictive Modeling**: Machine learning for consumption forecasting
- **Cross-chain Comparisons**: Standardized methodology across networks

## Validation and Peer Review

**External Validation**: This methodology has been:
- Reviewed by blockchain sustainability researchers
- Compared against similar network assessments
- Validated through community feedback processes

**Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates based on:
- New data availability and quality improvements
- Technological changes in validator infrastructure
- Evolution of grid carbon intensity factors
- Community feedback and expert recommendations

## Transparency and Reproducibility

**Open Source Approach**: All calculation methodologies, data sources, and assumptions are publicly documented to enable:
- Independent verification of results
- Adaptation for other blockchain networks  
- Community contributions and improvements
- Academic research and peer review

**Data Availability**: Where possible, underlying data sets are made available for research purposes, respecting privacy and security considerations.
